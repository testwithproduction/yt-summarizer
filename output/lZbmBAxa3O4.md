# Transcription

 Yeah. All right. Hi, everyone. Thanks, Ali. Yes, I have the new Unity Catalog t-shirt. Yep. You'll be able to get one soon, I think, somewhere. All right, so I have a somewhat longer session for you today, because I'm talking about governance with open source Unity Catalog, as well as data sharing. If you're familiar, we have another open source project. We launched delta sharing that's really making waves in the open data collaboration space. And we have a lot of exciting announcements around that. So I'll start by talking about what's new in Unity Catalog and what it means to open source it, why we did it, what's in there. And then, so Ali announced that we're open sourcing it yesterday, but he led me keep one more thing to announce today that I'll talk about. That's the next big direction for Unity Catalog. And then, finally, I'll switch gears to sharing and collaboration, and we'll have some cool demos of all these things, too. So let's start with Unity Catalog. So I think everyone who works in data and AI knows that governance, whether it's for security or quality or compliance, remains a huge challenge for many applications. And it's getting even harder with generative AI. There are new regulations being written all the time about it. I heard in California alone there are 80 builds proposed. That regulate AI in some form. And also, you need to really understand where your data is coming from if you're going to create models and deploy them and run these applications. So we hear things from our customers all the time about how they would love to use AI, but they can't really govern it with their existing frameworks. And even on the data space, it's complex enough. Even there, all the rules are changing, and people are really worried about how to best do it. So we wanted to step back and think, it's 2024. If you had to design an ideal governance solution from scratch today, what would you want it to have? We asked a bunch of CIOs. And we thought you really wanted to have three things. The first thing is what we call open connectivity. So you should be able to take any data, any source that's in your organization, and plug it into the governance solution. Because no one's going to migrate everything into just one data system over time. Most organizations have hundreds or thousands of these. So you really want a governance solution that can really cover all this data wherever it lives, in any format, even in other platforms. Then we also really think you need unified governance across data and AI. I think it's clearer than ever with generative AI that you have to manage these together. You can't be managing AI without knowing what data went into it. And also, all the output of AI, as you do serving, is going to be data about how your application is doing. It's got the same problems of quality and security. So we really need it to be unified. And then finally, we heard everyone asking for open access from any compute engine or client. Because there are so many great solutions out there, they'll keep coming out. They'll be the next data processing engine, the next machine learning library. You want it to work with your data. So this is what we're building with Unity Catalog, especially with the open source launch today. So first of all, open connectivity, Unity Catalog on Databricks and Databricks as a platform uniquely lets you connect data in other systems as well and process it together in a very efficient way through this feature we call Lakehouse Federation. So you can really connect all your data and give users a single place where you set security policies, you manage quality, and you make it available. It also is the only governance system in the industry, really, that's unified governance for data and AI. So since the beginning, since we launched this three years ago, we had support for tables, models, files, and we're adding new concepts as they come out in the AI world, like tools, which we talked about yesterday with the tool catalog concept for GenAI agents. And for all these things, you can get these capabilities on top ranging from access control to lineage to monitoring and end discovery. And finally, one of the big things that is possible today through the open API and open source project we just launched is open access to all your tables through a wide range of applications. I'll talk more about that in a bit. But the cool thing here is, again, it's not just data systems like DoctiB, but also a lot of the leading machine learning ones like LangChain can integrate with Unity Catalog. And since we launched this, it's been extremely widely adopted. Most of our customers use Unity Catalog now. And some of them are managing tens of petabytes of data on it like GM or have thousands of active users like Pepsi here. So I'm going to briefly talk about some of the new things, some quick announcements in each of these areas. And then we're going to see a demo of how all these things fit together, including with the open source project. So let me start with open connectivity. So I'm really excited today to announce GA of Lakehouse Federation, the ability to connect and manage external data sources in Unity. Yeah. Thanks, everyone. This is a feature that we launched last year, a year ago at Summit. It builds on Apache Spark's unique ability to combine many data sources efficiently. And it lets you mount these data sources in Databricks, set governance rules on top, and get the same experience, managing quality, tracking lineage, and so on, as people work on them that you get with your Delta tables in there. And it's been growing extremely quickly. We now have 5,000 monthly active customers. And if you look at that graph of queries on Lakehouse Federation, it's still growing exponentially. So we see a lot of customers that can finally bring all this disparate data, which is a reality in every company. As much as every data vendor would love for you to have all your stuff in one system, it is just not the case, and actually work with it together. And another really cool thing that we're announcing is Lakehouse Federation for Apache Hive and Glue. So if you've got an existing Hive meta store or glue, you've got lots of tables in there, you can now connect that efficiently to Unity catalog and manage the data in that as well. And that's rolling out later this year. So very excited about this. It's a defining feature of Databricks as a data platform. So what about unified governance across data and AI? There's so much happening in this space. And our team has been working hard to launch a whole range of new features here. So I won't even have time to go through all of them. But just in the past year, we've got everything from AI-assisted documentation and tagging to improvements to lineage, sharing, monitoring, and so on. And I'm just going to highlight two announcements here around A-back and around Lakehouse monitoring. So first, Lakehouse monitoring is going GA. So Lakehouse monitoring is the ability to take any table or machine learning model in Unity catalog and automatically check for quality on it. There's a lot of built-in quality checks. Like, are there a lot of nulls? Has it stopped being updated, and so on? Plus, you can do custom checks. And the great thing about this, since it's integrated into the data platform, we know exactly when the data changes or when the model is called. So it's very efficient. And it does all this computation incrementally. And it gives you these rich dashboards about quality, classification of the data discovered, and so on. Plus, all these reports go into these tables. So you can just programatically see the quality of your entire data and AI state there. So that's going GA today. And sorry, I should say that's already in use at thousands of customers. And then the second thing that we're launching a preview of soon is attribute-based access control. So we've developed this policy builder and tagging system where you can set tags on your data at any level in the catalog. We'll also auto-populate tags based on patterns of data we discover. And you can then propagate these masking policies across all of them. And this works easily through the UI or through SQL. So these are just two of the things. Thanks. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. And then the last but not least, the thing I'm probably most excited about is the launch of open source Unity catalog and open access. So a lot of people asked me yesterday, why are you open sourcing Unity catalog? And really, it's because customers need it. Customers are looking to design their data platform architecture for the next few decades. And they want to build on an open foundation. And today, even though you see a lot of cloud data platforms that claim support for openness in some way, when you dig into them, they don't really truly follow through on that. So there are a lot of cloud data warehouses out there, for example, that could read tables, say in Delta Lake or Iceburg. But most of them also have their native tables that are more efficient, more optimized. And they really urge you to use those and to have your data locked in. And then there are other platforms, even some of the Lake platforms, where it seems like everything's in an open format. But you have to pay for always on compute and pay a high fee if you ever read it from outside their engine. And customers don't want that. Everyone is saying they want an open lake house where they own the data, no vendor owns the data, without lock-in, and where they can use any compute engine in the future. So we've been big fans of this approach for a while. We think it's where the world is going. So that's why we design everything we do to support it. And already today, in Databricks, all your data is in an open format. There's no concept of a native table. We also pioneered this cross-format compatibility last year with Uniform, where all these ecosystems of clients that only understand Apache, Iceburg, or Hoody can still read your tables. And the next logical step is to also provide open source catalog. So this is what we have in the first release of Unity Catalog. We'll be gradually releasing the things that we built in our platform and removing all the dependencies on Databricks code and putting them in the open source project. But even in the first release, you'll be able to govern tables on structured data and AI. And we're really excited. We proposed the project to the Linux Foundation, and it's been accepted this morning, so it will be there. Yeah, thanks. [? Applause ?] And then another cornerstone of Unity Catalog is we're doubling down on the cross-format compatibility approach. So even the first release implements the Iceburg REST API. It's one of the first open source catalogs that implements this format. So you can connect to it from any engine that understands that. And we hope that means that a lot of the ecosystem out there will work with it. All right, so you might be asking, is this for real? When are you actually releasing it? Maybe in 90 days, maybe 89 days, because Aliyah announced it yesterday. I'm just going to walk over to my laptop right here. [? Applause ?] Yeah, so this is Unity Catalog on GitHub. You know, looks solid to me. People are working hard on it. So just going to go into the settings here, scroll down to the Danger Zone, and make this thing public. Yep, I want to make it public. I understand. Make it public. [? Applause ?] All right, and I think it's public now. So yeah, take a look. So github.com Unity Catalog. [? Applause ?] Thanks, everyone. Yeah, so that wasn't that hard. And of course, we invite all of you to contribute. We'll be working hard to expand the project. And we want to do it all in the open. We're not going to keep it closed for a while to build this stuff up. All right, so yeah, it is now available. My site is right. So we just released version 0.1. This version supports tables, volumes for unstructured data, and AI tools and functions. So it implements that tool catalog concept we talked about yesterday. Has the iSpoke support. And if you look at our website, it's going to it has open source server, APIs, and clients. And these work just as well with your instance of Unity Catalog on Databricks. So everything built that you can just connect to your current data. We're also really excited to have a great array of launch partners everywhere from the cloud vendors, some of which have been contributing a lot to open standards like the iSpoke Progress API already, to leading companies in AI and in governance. So Microsoft, AWS, Google, they're all excited to see this happening. And we hope to work closely with them to contribute to Apache iSpoke as well and to help define the standards for this so customers get the interoperability that they want. And then, OK, sorry. And of course, there is a lot more coming. We're working on bringing a lot of the nice things you have in Databricks on Unity out here, including Delta sharing, models, MLflow integration, views, and other things. And we invite you again to collaborate with us. So that's kind of an overview of Unity Catalog. Some of our launch is in there. It's great to hear about them, but even better to see a demo. And for that, I'd like to invite Zeeshan Papa, one of our product managers, to show you through all these new features.
