# Summary

The final portion of the talk discusses key initiatives in data sharing and cross-organization collaboration, highlighting the increasing importance of these practices in modern business. The speaker emphasizes the benefits of data sharing, such as better coordination between providers and suppliers and streamlined business processes, citing an example where a customer expected to double their speed in launching new drugs by adopting such technologies.

Key Points:

1. **Initiative Background and Approach**:
   - Three years ago, the team began focusing on creating an open collaboration ecosystem based on open standards.
   - They aimed to avoid the limitations of closed data platforms by allowing cross-platform data sharing.

2. **Core Technology - Delta Sharing**:
   - Delta Sharing, a feature of Delta Lake, securely shares data tables across different platforms and clouds using an open protocol.
   - It simplifies data sharing by allowing access through various tools like pandas, Apache Spark, Tableau, and Power BI without needing the recipient to install a data warehouse.

3. **Adoption and Growth**:
   - Went GA (Generally Available) two years ago.
   - Currently, over 16,000 recipients use Delta Sharing, with 40% of recipients not on Databricks, indicating successful cross-platform collaboration.
   - Growth is fourfold year on year.

4. **Future Expansion**:
   - Delta Sharing will integrate with Lakehouse Federation to streamline sharing data from any source to any application understanding the Delta sharing protocol.

5. **Databricks Marketplace**:
   - Launched two years ago, now with over 2000 listings, growing more than 4x annually.
   - Provides features such as private exchanges, sharing of non-data assets like models, usage analytics, and support for non-data-based clients.
   - Welcoming 12 new partners, including industry leaders, to enhance data availability across platforms.

The talk concludes with the speaker expressing excitement for the future growth and potential of these initiatives in improving global data collaboration.

 Final portion of the talk I want to talk about I want to talk about what we're doing in sharing and cross org Collaboration you if you know if depending what industry you're in you've probably seen that data sharing and collaboration between companies between organizations is Becoming a really important part of the modern data space. It can help, you know providers and suppliers coordinate better. It can help, you know Streamline a lot of business processes just yesterday I met a customer who thought that they could speed up basically launching new drugs by a factor of two by Implementing these kind of technologies so so really you know really powerful way for for many industries to move forward And we started looking at this area about three years ago We wanted to provide great support for it and we started by talking to a lot of data providers who collaborate and what they told us was that Many of the data platforms out there support some kind of sharing between different instances But it's always closed you can only share, you know within that same data platform within that You know customers of that data warehouse or whatever and as a provider or as you know any company that wants to collaborate with a lot of partners This is very restrictive so and parody for example who's a who's a CDP Said that they would prefer to invest in open solutions that let them You know set up data collaboration once and then be able to reach anyone regardless of what platform they're computing on So that's the approach that we've taken with all our sharing and collaboration infrastructure by creating an open collaboration ecosystem based on open standards and the core of that is Delta sharing a feature of Delta Lake that allows you to securely share tables, you know across clouds and across data platforms and then we've built on that with Databricks Marketplace and Databricks cleaners So if you're not familiar with Delta sharing Basically, this is a core part of the Delta Lake project where if you have you know a table and Increasingly other kinds of assets as well You can on this the server that has an open protocol and serve out just parts of your table to other parties that are Authorized to access them and because the protocol is open. It's a very simple one based on parquet You know files that are that are that they're given access to it's really easy to implement a lot of consumers So of course you can use Databricks to access these but you can also just use pandas a patchy spark Even bi products like Tableau and power bi Are letting you load data right into there and it makes a lot of sense You know if you're a data provider you want to publish something Why should the other party even need to install a data warehouse in the first place? Why not deliver that data say straight to Tableau or straight to Excel or something like that? So so that's Delta sharing it went GA two years ago and it's continuing to go extremely quickly So just this year. I mean just now we have over 16,000 recipients that are receiving data through Delta sharing from our customers on the Databricks platform And this is going by a factor of four year on year So there's no no end in sight we're super excited about this and the other thing I'm really proud of is that 40% of those recipients are not on Databricks So this idea of cross platform collaboration is is real and our customers are able to deliver Data and to have you know real-time data exchange with anyone regardless of what data platform they're using So super excited about the growth of that this year We are Continuing to expand Delta sharing and one really exciting announcement is that we're hooking together two of the the best features of the platform Lakehouse Federation and sharing to let you share data Automatically from other data sources as well So we talked to a lot of companies who have some data and a data warehouse or they have a partner who you know isn't on Databricks has another Platform but they want to collaborate and since we built this Federation technology that can efficiently Quay this data push down filter is get it out and and deliver it We are just connecting that to Delta sharing to let you seamlessly do this So now you can really share data from you know any data warehouse any database with any app that understands the Delta sharing protocol So that's that's Delta sharing. Thanks. Yeah excited about that feature. Yeah All right, so one of the the the things that builds on Delta sharing is Databricks marketplace This is something we launched about two years ago and it's it's Also been going extremely quickly Databricks marketplace is now up to over 2000 listings again going more than 4x year on year So super excited to see that and this makes it actually up there with the largest Data market places anywhere in the cloud on any platform So it's and it's it's continuing to go our team has been adding a whole bunch of new functionality there that providers are asking for like private exchanges Sharing of non-data assets like models and volumes usage analytics and even support for non-data-based clients if you put data in there You know, you can you can reach these other platforms as well And then we are also super excited to welcome 12 new partners to this To the sharing and marketplace ecosystems some of these announcements went out last week But anywhere from from axiom, I'm parody Atlassian Industry leaders in in in many different domains are now connecting to this ecosystems and making data Available to users on Databricks or really on any platform that implements the open sharing protocol and they join our existing Ecosystem of partners so thanks to all of them who are participating in this Great so yeah, really really excited to see how this will continue to go in the future
