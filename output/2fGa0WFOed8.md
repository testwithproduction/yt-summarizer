# Summary

The speaker begins by expressing excitement for the second day of the event and thanks partners such as GSIs, hyperscalers, and ISVs for making the program possible. Attendees are encouraged to visit the Xpo Hall to see the partners’ work.

Key points from the upcoming program:
- Presentations from the Texas Rangers, DuckDB creator, Matej Zaharia (Spark project founder), Apache Iceberg’s original creator Ryan Blue, Deposit, RStudio Tareef, and Professor Yechin from UW.
- Numerous announcements are planned.

Summary of key points from the previous day:
1. **Acquisition of Tabular**: Discussion on uniting Delta Lake and Apache Iceberg formats for better compatibility, introduced the GA of Project Uniform for universal data format.
2. **Gen AI**: Focused on data intelligence using proprietary/custom data, aiming for cost-efficiency and privacy.
3. **Agent Framework**: Released for building compound AI systems.
4. **Data Warehousing**: Reynolds highlighted a 73% performance improvement in BI workloads on Databricks over the past two years.
5. **AI BI**: Introduction of a new AI-driven BI project to revolutionize traditional BI, available in Databricks.

# Transcription

 Everybody, hey, super excited day two here. We have an awesome program in front of us. But I want to start by, first again, thanking our partners. Without them, this program would not be possible. So I want to thank the GSIs and the hyperscalers and all the ISVs that you see on this picture. Please go to the Xpo Hall, check out what they're up to. OK, so we have a really awesome program in front of us today. You're going to hear from Texas Rangers. You're going to hear from DuckDB creator. You're going to hear from Matej Zaharia, who started the Spark project, who's going to talk about UC. We're going to hear about Apache Iceberg, from the original creator of the project, Ryan Blue. And then we're going to hear from Deposit and RStudio Tareef, and then Professor Yechin from UW. And then we have lots of lots of announcements today. Before I jump in, I wanted to quickly recap yesterday. So in case you missed it, yesterday, we talked about the acquisition of Tabular, which was a company started by the original creators of Apache Iceberg. And what we talked about is how we intend to bring these formats closer and closer together, Delta Lake and Apache Iceberg. And if you want compatibility today, or if you want interoperability today, we announced the GA of Uniform. So Store Your Data in Project Uniform stands for Universal Format. And you will get the best of both of those formats. We've got all the original creators of both of those projects. We're making sure that Uniform really works well with both. So that was the first thing that we announced. Second, we talked about Gen AI. And in Gen AI, we kind of talked about how lots of companies are focused on general intelligence, which is super cool. Models that are really good at anything. You can ask them about history, math, and so on. But we're focused on data intelligence. Data intelligence is not just general intelligence. It's intelligence on your data, on your custom data, on the proprietary data of your organization, being able to do that at a reasonable cost and with privacy intact. We talked about compound AI systems and the agent framework that we released yesterday that lets you build your own compound AI systems. And then we heard from Reynolds yesterday about data warehousing. And he talked about the performance improvements that we've seen over the just last two years. So just BI workloads, concurrent workloads on BI. We saw 73% improvement on the BI workloads that are running on Databricks the last two years. So we're just tracking those over two years. It's massive improvement. So check it out. And then I was very excited about AI BI. So AI BI was a project that we built from the ground up with generative AI in mind to completely disrupt how we do BI today. So that's also available in Databricks. So check it out.
