 Okay, awesome. So I just want to wrap this up quickly. So on the top row there, you see the announcements from yesterday. I'm not going to bore you and go through those again. On the bottom row, you can see what we did today. So we just heard data engineering, so you saw that. Unity catalog, open source, live on stage by Matei. That was super cool. But also metrics. I'm excited about metrics. Every company has KPIs. How do we have certified KPIs that we can rely on and that we know are semantically correct and we know how to compute them. So that's also a big deal. And then we heard about Delta Lake 4.0 and Project Uniform going GA. So lots and lots of great stuff. And that's it for today.
