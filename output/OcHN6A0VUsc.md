# Summary

The talk covers the following key points about Unity Catalog and its enhancements:

1. **Introduction to Unity Catalog**:
   - Unity Catalog allows setting up a catalog with access control, monitoring, and the ability to federate data into it for usage by various engines.

2. **Need for Business-Specific Metrics**:
   - Simply having tables and schemas is insufficient for answering detailed business queries (e.g., ARR trends in EMEA).
   - There is a need to bridge the gap by understanding business-specific definitions, calculations, and regional demarcations.

3. **Announcement of Unity Catalog Metrics**:
   - Unity Catalog will include first-class support for metrics, enabling metric definitions and management alongside other assets.
   - This feature includes governance, searchability, audit events, and lineage tracking for metrics.
   - Designed to be open and usable with multiple BI tools and AI-BI integrations.

4. **Partnerships and Integrations**:
   - Unity Catalog will work with external metrics providers like DBT, Qube, and AdScale to manage metrics within Unity.

5. **Demo Highlights**:
   - **Business Metrics Overview**: Users can view and interact with certified sales metrics within Unity Catalog, such as "Web Revenue".
   - **Metric Details**: The overview tab provides metadata, predefined dimensions (e.g., date, location), and other relevant metric information.
   - **Usage in Dashboards**: Metrics can be utilized directly in dashboards with dimensions available for filtering (e.g., country, city).
   - **Notebook Integration**: Metrics can be queried from external tools and notebooks using functions like `get_metric`.
   - **Natural Language Queries**: Metrics can be used to answer natural language queries, expanding their accessibility and utility.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Unity Catalog Metrics simplify the process for any user to discover and use trusted data for informed decision-making across the organization.

# Transcription

 Thanks so much, Zestran. All right, so that's Unity Catalog in action. So as I said, Ali led me keep one thing to announce today, which I'm really excited about. So what we just saw is you could set up a catalog. It's open. It's got access control, monitoring. You can get to it from any engine. You can federate stuff into it. Are you done? As an engineer, you might say this is pretty good. What will happen, unfortunately, is someone will come in and ask a business question. For example, how is my ARR trending in EMEA? And to answer this kind of question, there's not enough information in just the catalog, in just the table schemas and things like that. So you have to understand things like, how is ARR defined? That's some kind of unique calculation for your business. Maybe there are many tables that mention ARR. Which one actually is the right one to use to get this information? How is EMEA defined? Which countries are really part of it, and so on. And so the question is, how do you bridge this gap? So this is something that is typically done in some kind of metrics layer. And we're really excited to announce that we're adding first class support for metrics as a concept in Unity Catalog. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, so this is something we've, we'll be rolling out later this year. So Unity Catalog metrics. So the idea here is that you can define metrics inside Unity Catalog and manage them together with all the other assets. So you can set governance rules on them. You can find them in search. You can get audit events. You can get lineage for them, and so on. And like the other parts of Unity, we're taking an open approach to this. We want you to be able to use the metrics in any downstream tool. So we're going to expose them to multiple BI tools. So you can pick the BI tool of your choice. We'll, of course, integrate them with AI BI. One of the things we're excited about is we're designing this from the beginning to be AI friendly so that AI BI and similar tools can really understand how to use these and give you great results. And you'll be able to just use them through SQL, through table functions that you can compute on. And we are also partnering with DBT, Qube, and AdScale as external metrics provider to make it easy to bring in and govern and manage metrics from those inside Unity. So to show this stuff in action, I'd like to invite Zeeshan to the stage again for a quick demo of metrics. [? Music playing ?] Thanks, Batae. As you mentioned, metrics enhance business users' ability to ask questions, understand the organization's data, and ultimately make better decisions. Rather than sifting through all of the data, certified business metrics can be governed, discovered, and queried efficiently through Unity Catalog. Having already discussed the Catalog Explorer, let's dive into business metrics. In this Overview tab here, you'll see a list of all available sales metrics. A few of these metrics are marked certified. This indicates a higher level of trustworthiness. We're going to select the Web Revenue metric down below here. As you can see, it's also marked certified. By clicking into this, you can see the metadata that's associated with this metric and the predefined dimensions that are associated with Web Revenue. These are used when querying the metrics, such as date or location. This is like having a built-in instruction manual for your data. On the right-hand side here, you can see the Metric Overview section. This is where you can see the description of the metric, who edited it, and who certified it. You can also see information about where the metric came from and where the metric is used, such as notebooks, dashboards, and data. Let's click into this dashboard. As you can see in this dashboard over here on the right-hand side in the x-axis column, I have all of the interesting information, such as the dimensions and country, city, state, et cetera. This allows you to slice and dice without needing to fully understand the data model. Let's go into a notebook as well. This metric isn't just usable in a dashboard. It's also queryable from external tools and notebooks. In this notebook, you can see the dimensions of the data model. In this notebook, we're using the get metric function to pull all aggregated data. It's that simple. Finally, let's go back into a genie space. Here, Web Revenue Metrics can be used to answer natural language questions. In this space, you'll also see that this visualization was created by asking about the revenue generated across states using this metric. This approach extends the reach of these metrics throughout the organization, making them accessible to business users. As you can see, Mate, Unity Catalog Metrics make it easy for any user to discover and use trusted data to make better decisions. [?]. [?]. [?]. [?]. ?] [?]. [?]. [?]. [?]. [?]. ?]
