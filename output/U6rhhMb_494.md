# Summary

The transcript is from a technical talk discussing the collaboration between Databricks and a prominent individual in the data formats field. Key points include:

1. **Introduction and Congratulations**: Welcoming the speaker to Databricks, expressing excitement about the new chapter in data formats.
  
2. **Main Benefit of Joining Databricks**: The collaboration aims to simplify data formats, removing worries about making long-term format choices and ensuring compatibility through a single standard.

3. **The Speaker's Vision**: The goal is to let users focus on deriving value from their data rather than dealing with the complexities of table and file formats.

4. **Origin Story of Iceberg**: At Netflix, challenges with atomicity and data correctness led to the creation of Iceberg due to limitations in the Hive format. Open-sourcing Iceberg accelerated its development through community collaboration.

5. **Influence from Parquet Project**: Experiences from the Parquet project highlighted the need for solving table-level issues, feeding into the development of Iceberg.

6. **Historical Discussions on Interoperability**: Both parties have discussed interoperability in the past; the maturity of current formats has made collaboration to avoid duplication logical.

7. **Community Investment**: The partnership signifies a substantial investment in the Iceberg community and aims to enhance both Delta Lake and Iceberg.

8. **Future Collaborations**: Excitement about addressing engineering challenges together, with the ultimate goal of making data format concerns irrelevant to end-users.

Overall, the talk emphasizes the shared vision and mutual benefits of combining efforts to improve data format standards and make them more user-friendly.

 Hey, Ryan. Hey, good to be here. Awesome. OK, so congratulations. Welcome to Databricks. Thank you. We are really excited to be here and also excited to get started on this new chapter in data formats. Awesome. So what's the main benefit of joining Databricks? Why join forces? I've never wanted people to worry about formats. Formats have always been a way for us to take on more responsibility as a platform and take responsibilities from people who worry about things. When we started this, people were worrying about whether or not things completed atomically. And so this next chapter is really about how do we remove the choice and the need to stress over, am I making this the right choice for the next 10 years? That weighs a lot on people. And I think we want to make sure that everything is compatible, that we're all running in the same direction, with the single standard, if possible. Hopefully we can get there. Yeah, I think we're going to get there. Actually, you had a talk a while ago that said something like, I want you to not know about these formats in iceberg. Well, it was some title, right? Exactly. I don't want anyone thinking about table formats or file formats or anything like that. That's a massive distraction from what people actually want to get done in their jobs. So I want people focusing on getting value out of their data and not the minutia. That's the kind of nerdy problem that I get excited about. Leave that to us. Hey, I like it. As a nerd, I think it's awesome. We've got thousands of people to learn how to do acid transactions and understand all the underpinnings of the stuff that I otherwise would not give a damn about. OK, well, everybody wants to hear like origin stories. So can you tell us a little bit? How did the iceberg get started? What's the sort of history? Well, at Netflix, we were really grappling with a number of different problem areas. Atomicity was one that we didn't trust transactions and what was happening to our data. We also had issues like more correctness problems. You couldn't rename a column properly and those sorts of things. And we realized that the nexus of all of the user problems was the format level. We just had too simplistic of a format with the Hive format. And we decided to do something about it. And then I think the real turning point was actually when we open sourced it and started working with the community because it turns out everyone had that problem and we could just move so much faster with the community. It's been an amazing experience. And you started, you were involved in the starting of the Parquet project before that, right? Was some of these thoughts even discussed to do this kind of intimacy and so on back there or now? So part of my experience in the Parquet project informed what we did here because there were several things that just were not file level issues. They were this next level of really table level concerns. Like what's the current schema of a table? You can't tell that from just looking at all the files. Yeah. A lot of people think that this is the first time we're talking about these things, you and I and others. But this isn't the first time we're actually talking about interoperability and how to make this work, right? That's true. We've been in touch over the years talking about this several times. I'm glad that we finally got to the point where it made sense. I think we were always going and doing our own things. But now we've gotten to the point where both formats are good enough that we're actually duplicating effort. And the most logical thing to do is this. It is to start working together, start avoiding any duplication if possible between the two. Yeah. That's super awesome. OK. So I think a lot of people here are wondering, Pachi, iceberg community. Well, I'm really excited because I see this as a big commitment and a pretty massive investment in the iceberg community and the health of both Delta Lake and iceberg in general. I'm very excited personally to work on this and do a whole bunch of fun engineering problems. And that'll be really nice. Awesome, man. Super, super excited to partner with you, collaborate on Delta, Uniform, Iceberg, all these formats, and then make it such that no one here ever needs to care about this ever again. Thanks so much. Thank you. Thank you. Good. Good. Yeah.
