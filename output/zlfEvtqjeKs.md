# Transcription

 So, what have we done today? You see this is the data intelligence platform. You can see it on the slide here. So, we've covered, there's AKI, the generative AI stuff. We've covered Databricks SQL, Reynolds did that, AIBI, we just heard that. And tomorrow we have awesome talks. Let me just summarize for you a little bit what we saw just today. So, we saw on the tabular side, the acquisition, how we're going to bring interoperability on these formats. On generative AI, how we can build your own AI and build it into production on your own custom data. Data Warehousing, we saw amazing performance, and especially on BI. So, give it a try, it's getting better every year. And then, of course, AIBI, where you can just talk in English. And tomorrow we're going to focus on workflows, how to do data engineering, and how we're going to actually run streaming pipelines, as well as Unity catalog. We're going to hear from Matei and the open sourcing. And then, of course, Delta Lake. And we're going to have actually Ryan Blue from Apache Berg on stage here. So that's it for today.
